# Data Types

## CSS Grid Container

CSS Grid Container can hold Placeholder Rectangle, Text, and CSS Grid Container types.

## Placeholder Rectangle

Placeholder Rectangle can specify its sizing. 
- Sizing should be either fixed or extrinsic. 
- Sizing is in width and height, and they can be specified individually.

For example:
- If width is extrinsically sized, it behaves the same as the default width of `<div>`
- If height is extrinsically sized, it behaves the same as `height: 100%` in CSS for `<div>`

## Text

Text holds content.
